<ul>
<li><p>M2.6 * 10mm</p> : Shorter grip screws
<li><p>M2.6 * 12mm</p> : Longer "general body" screws
<li><p>M2.6 * 16mm</p> : The "single" long screw used in bottom left
<li><p>M3 * 10mm</p> : Replacement stock attachment point screws. These ensure the cap remains attached when using this piece as the spring retention part in a Retalicon/expanded back Retaliator.
