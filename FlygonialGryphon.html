Notes: There is no right flywheel to use here - if you really want to save money, grab a pair off a stock Stryfe, or buy any worker offering regardless of texture.

6. One full-sized microswitch, 15A or 21A

7. M3 nuts
(See below)

8. M3 screws:
: 5mm length
: 8mm length
: 10mm length

: 1* 20mm length for one specific screw on the motor cover

Notes: I found myself in want of more M3*8, so perhaps buy more of those if you're building more: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32810852732.html

9. M2 screws: 4-5mm length for motor mounting.

: 50mm in length for the trigger return spring
